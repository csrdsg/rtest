**Homework: Univariate Regression**

Download the `used-cars_cities_prep.csv` data table from OSF and perform the following tasks:

1. In this task, you will examine the relationship between car age (x, years) and price (y, USD). What kind of relationship do you think exists between these two variables, and why?
2. Run a univariate regression where the dependent variable is car price (price) and the independent variable is car age (age). Interpret the obtained coefficients.

3. Check the price variable. If you find observations with extreme values, discard them. If you discard any observations, describe how many and explain your reasoning. Continue working with this new data table.
4. Calculate and interpret the mean, median, and standard deviation of the price. Plot the distribution of this variable using a histogram. Briefly describe the insights gained from the graph.
5. Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between price and age. Interpret the graph.
6. Calculate and interpret the linear correlation coefficient between price and age.
7. Run a univariate regression where the dependent variable is car price (price) and the independent variable is car age (age). Interpret the obtained coefficients.
8. Compare the β coefficients obtained in points 2) and 7). Is there a difference? If so, how large is it (small, large)? Briefly evaluate the importance of handling extreme values based on these findings. (We will revisit this question next week.)
    Continue working with the model estimated in point 7)!
9. What is the R-squared of the model? Interpret its meaning.
10. Perform one interpolation and one extrapolation for an x value each using the model. Describe your process and interpret the results.
11. Which are the 3 most expensive and 3 cheapest cars relative to their age? How did you determine these? Why do you think they might be over- or underpriced?
