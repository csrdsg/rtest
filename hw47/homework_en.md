**Homework Assignment**

Your task is to understand the relationship pattern between countries' income generation (y) and the ease of starting a business (x). For the analysis, download cross-sectional data on GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2021 international $) (found in the World Development Indicators database) and Time required to start a business (days) (found in the Jobs database) from the World Bank's website. Do not use country groups, only individual countries. The final result of the analysis should be a regression model and a precise interpretation of its results. When selecting the final model, address the functional forms, as well as the handling of extreme values and high-leverage observations. At each step, describe what you did and why (supported by figures, statistics, intuitive reasoning, etc.).
