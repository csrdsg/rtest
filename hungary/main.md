Longitudinal Economic Comparison Outline: Hungary vs. Neighbors (2010–Present)
Objective: Analyze the decade-plus economic trajectory of Hungary in comparison to its seven direct neighbors, focusing on key World Bank Development Indicators (WDI) from the start of the post-2008 recovery phase (2010) through the most recent available data (e.g., 2024).
I. Introduction and Scope
A. Timeframe and Context

1. Period: 2010–Present (focusing on yearly data points).
2. Key Events to Note: Post-Global Financial Crisis recovery (2010-2013), EU integration/Eurozone issues, COVID-19 pandemic response (2020-2022).
3. Target Countries (N=8): Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia.
   B. Data Source and Metrics
4. Source: World Bank Development Indicators (WDI).
5. Analytical Approach: Comparison of baseline data (2010), end-of-period data (most recent), and average/cumulative performance over the entire period.
   II. Key Comparative Indicators (World Bank Data Variables)
   For each indicator, the analysis should compare the 2010 value, the most recent value, and the average/cumulative performance.
   A. Living Standards and Economic Output
6. GDP per capita, PPP (Current International $) (Code: NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD)
   • Analysis Focus: Convergence/Divergence. How did Hungary's standard of living, adjusted for purchasing power, track compared to the high-income benchmark (Austria) and the Central/Eastern European (CEE) neighbors over time?
7. GDP Growth (Annual %) (Code: NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)
   • Analysis Focus: Resilience and Catch-up. Calculate the average annual growth rate (2010-Present) to assess long-term momentum. Analyze peak performance years and recession years (e.g., 2020).
   B. Macroeconomic Stability and Vulnerability
8. Inflation, consumer prices (Annual %) (Code: FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG)
   • Analysis Focus: Price Stability. Compare the average inflation rate over the period, highlighting divergence points (e.g., post-2021 energy crisis impact).
9. Central Government Debt, Total (% of GDP) (Code: GC.DTA.TOTL.GD.ZS)
   • Analysis Focus: Fiscal Consolidation. Compare the change in debt burden: (Recent Value - 2010 Value). Which countries successfully reduced their debt-to-GDP ratio, and which saw it increase?
   C. Structural and External Economy
10. Foreign Direct Investment, Net Inflows (% of GDP) (Code: BX.KLT.DINV.WD.GD.ZS)
    • Analysis Focus: External Attractiveness. Compare the overall trend and volatility in attracting foreign investment over the 15-year period.
11. Unemployment, Total (% of Total Labor Force) (Code: SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS)
    • Analysis Focus: Labor Market Health. Track the rate of job market recovery from 2010 onwards, comparing initial high rates (in some countries) to recent structural lows.
    III. Summary of Economic Trends (2010–Present)
    A. Convergence/Divergence
12. Assessment of whether Hungary's economy converged toward or diverged from the high-income neighbor (Austria) and the average CEE peer group.
    B. Crisis Resilience
13. Comparison of how fast Hungary recovered from the post-2008 slowdown and how sharply its economy reacted to the 2020 pandemic, relative to its neighbors.
    C. Key Policy Results
14. Summary of where Hungary's performance was strongest/weakest compared to the group based on the chosen indicators over the entire period
